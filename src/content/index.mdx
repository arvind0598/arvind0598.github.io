Hey there! I'm Arvind, a Full Stack Engineer based in Bengaluru. I've spent 5+ years building scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, and Java. I like to solve problems with product-heavy and tech-light solutions.

I'm currently at Smartstaff - I work here as a senior full stack engineer. We're solving problems in India's structured blue-collar industry.

You should check out my <a href={config.resumeLink}>resume</a>, connect with me on <a href={config.linkedinLink}>LinkedIn</a>, or just drop me a line at <a href={config.email}>hello@arvindsuresh.in</a>. I'm always excited to chat about technology, how much AI is overestimated right now, and opportunities that let me solve problems at a larger scale.
