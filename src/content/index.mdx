Hey there! I'm Arvind, a Senior Full Stack Engineer based in Bengaluru. Here's my <a href={config.resumeLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View Arvind's resume (opens in new tab)">resume</a> if you want the full story. I've spent 5+ years building systems that actually make a difference - from marketplaces handling thousands of transactions to automation tools that save teams hundreds of hours. I love turning complex problems into simple solutions that people enjoy using.

I'm currently at <a href={config.smartstaffLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Visit Smartstaff website (opens in new tab)">Smartstaff</a>, where I'm helping build better solutions for India's blue-collar workforce. I work primarily with React, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, and Java. I've previously worked at <a href={config.blackRockLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Visit BlackRock website (opens in new tab)">BlackRock</a> to help automate away 1000+ hours of work annually.

Connect with me on <a href={config.linkedinLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Connect on LinkedIn (opens in new tab)">LinkedIn</a>, or drop me a line at <a href={config.email} aria-label="Send email to Arvind">hello@arvindsuresh.in</a>. I'm always excited to chat about technology, food, games, and opportunities that let me solve problems at a larger scale.
